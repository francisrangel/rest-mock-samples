Some samples of rest-mock usage

### Selenium WebDriver

See the folder selenium for the samples using Selenium WebDriver to test, simulating a RESTful server.

These samples are using the, since 11th November 2013, the Firefox Webdriver. It expects a Firefox installation on the default location. In case you don't have Firefox and don't want to install it you can change the driver. For more information please visit: http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/
If you have installed Firefox in a different location, please take a look at this: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/FirefoxDriver
